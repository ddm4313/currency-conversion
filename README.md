# Currency Conversion in Python

Currency converting is very easy to implement with Python, all it takes is one simple line, we'll be using TransferWise rates, and I'll explain on how to get that data aswell.

First we ask for input, base_currency (i.e USD), amount to convert (i.e 1000 USD), and convert to which currency (i.e NZD), after that it'll simply send a get request to TransferWise's API and get rates, it'll use the latest rate and it'll convert.

And that's it, that's all there is to currency conversion in Python with 9 simple lines.
